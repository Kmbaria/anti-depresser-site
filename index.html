    <h1>TREATMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OVERCOMING DEPRESSION <img src="images/images.png">  </h1>
    <h2>Lets review the types of depression</h2>
    <p>They are as follows;
        <ul>
            <li>Major Depression</li>
            <li>Persistent Depression</li>
            <li>Manic Depression or Bipolar disorder</li>
            <li>Depressive psychosis</li>
            <li>Perinatal depression</li>
            <li>Seasonal depression</li>
            <li>Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder</li>
            <li>Situational Depression</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Medications and psychotherapy are effective for most people with depression. Your primary care doctor or psychiatrist can prescribe medications to relieve symptoms.
         However, many people with depression also benefit from seeing a psychiatrist, psychologist or other mental health professional.</p>
    <img src="images/download.png" id="med-icon">    
    <h2>Medications</h2>
    <div id="medication">
        <p>Many types of antidepressants are available, including those below.
            Be sure to discuss possible major side effects with your doctor or pharmacist.
           <ul>
               <li>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Doctors often start by prescribing an SSRI. These drugs are considered safer and generally cause fewer bothersome side effects than other types of antidepressants. SSRIs include citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva), sertraline (Zoloft) and vilazodone (Viibryd).</li>
               <li>Atypical antidepressants. These medications don't fit neatly into any of the other antidepressant categories. They include bupropion (Wellbutrin XL, Wellbutrin SR, Aplenzin, Forfivo XL), mirtazapine (Remeron), nefazodone, trazodone and vortioxetine (Trintellix).</li>
               <li>Tricyclic antidepressants. These drugs — such as imipramine (Tofranil), nortriptyline (Pamelor), amitriptyline, doxepin, trimipramine (Surmontil), desipramine (Norpramin) and protriptyline (Vivactil) — can be very effective, but tend to cause more-severe side effects than newer antidepressants. So tricyclics generally aren't prescribed unless you've tried an SSRI first without improvement.</li>
               <li>Other medications. Other medications may be added to an antidepressant to enhance antidepressant effects. Your doctor may recommend combining two antidepressants or adding medications such as mood stabilizers or antipsychotics. Anti-anxiety and stimulant medications also may be added for short-term use.</li>
           </ul>
           </p>
    </div>
    <img src="images/download (1).png" id="psycho-icon">    
    <h2>Psychotherapy</h2>
    <div id="psycho">
        <p>Psychotherapy is a general term for treating depression by talking about your condition and related issues with a mental health professional. Psychotherapy is also known as talk therapy or psychological therapy.
            Different types of psychotherapy can be effective for depression, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy. Your mental health professional may also recommend other types of therapies. Psychotherapy can help you:
            <ul>
                <li>Adjust to a crisis or other current difficulty</li>
                <li>Identify negative beliefs and behaviors and replace them with healthy, positive ones</li>
                <li>Explore relationships and experiences, and develop positive interactions with others</li>
                <li>Regain a sense of satisfaction and control in your life and help ease depression symptoms, such as hopelessness and anger</li>
                <li>Develop the ability to tolerate and accept distress using healthier behaviors</li>
                <li>Identify issues that contribute to your depression and change behaviors that make it worse</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <img src="images/images.jpeg" id="hos-icon" height="300px"width="300px"/>
    <h2>Hospital and residential treatment</h2>
    <div id="hospital">
        <p>In some people, depression is so severe that a hospital stay is needed. This may be necessary if you can't care for yourself properly or when you're in immediate danger of harming yourself or someone else. Psychiatric treatment at a hospital can help keep you calm and safe until your mood improves.
            Partial hospitalization or day treatment programs also may help some people. These programs provide the outpatient support and counseling needed to get symptoms under control.</p>

    <h2>Lifestyle and home remedies</h2>
    <div id="lifestyle">
        <p>Depression generally isn't a disorder that you can treat on your own. But in addition to professional treatment, these self-care steps can help:
            <ul>
                <li>Stick to your treatment plan. Don't skip psychotherapy sessions or appointments. Even if you're feeling well, don't skip your medications. If you stop, depression symptoms may come back, and you could also experience withdrawal-like symptoms. Recognize that it will take time to feel better.</li>
                <li>Learn about depression. Education about your condition can empower you and motivate you to stick to your treatment plan. Encourage your family to learn about depression to help them understand and support you.</li>
                <li>Pay attention to warning signs. Work with your doctor or therapist to learn what might trigger your depression symptoms. Make a plan so that you know what to do if your symptoms get worse. Contact your doctor or therapist if you notice any changes in symptoms or how you feel. Ask relatives or friends to help watch for warning signs.</li>
                <li>Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs. It may seem like alcohol or drugs lessen depression symptoms, but in the long run they generally worsen symptoms and make depression harder to treat. Talk with your doctor or therapist if you need help with alcohol or substance use.</li>
                <li>Take care of yourself. Eat healthy, be physically active and get plenty of sleep. Consider walking, jogging, swimming, gardening or another activity that you enjoy. Sleeping well is important for both your physical and mental well-being. If you're having trouble sleeping, talk to your doctor about what you can do.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <h2>Mind-body connections</h2>
    <div id="mindbody">
        <p>Integrative medicine practitioners believe the mind and body must be in harmony for you to stay healthy. Examples of mind-body techniques that may be helpful for depression include:
            <ul>
                <li>Acupuncture</li>
                <li>Relaxation techniques such as yoga or tai chi

    <h2>Coping and support</h2>
    <div id="support">
        <p>Talk with your doctor or therapist about improving your coping skills, and try these tips:
            <ul>
                <li>Simplify your life. Cut back on obligations when possible, and set reasonable goals for yourself. Give yourself permission to do less when you feel down.</li>
                <li>Write in a journal. Journaling, as part of your treatment, may improve mood by allowing you to express pain, anger, fear or other emotions.</li>
                <li>Read reputable self-help books and websites. Your doctor or therapist may be able to recommend books or websites to read.</li>
                <li>Locate helpful groups. Many organizations, such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, offer education, support groups, counseling and other resources to help with depression. Employee assistance programs and religious groups also may offer help for mental health concerns.</li>
                <li>Don't make important decisions when you're down. Avoid decision-making when you're feeling depressed, since you may not be thinking clearly.</li>
            </ul>

      <h1>UNDERSTANDING DEPRESSION</h1>
      <img src="img/dp.jpeg" alt="dp" width="1000" height="400"><br><br>
      <p>Everyone goes through periods of deep sadness and grief. These feelings usually fade away within a few days or weeks, depending<br> on the circumstances. But profound sadness that lasts more than two weeks and affects your ability to function may be a sign of depression.</p>
      <p>Depression plays a role in more than one half of all suicide attempts in the world,<br> whereas the lifetime risk of suicide among patients with untreated depressive disorder is nearly 20%.<br> According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death in<br> Third World Countries, accounting for 36,909 deaths; it was the second leading cause of death in people 25-34 years of age,<br> the third leading cause in people aged 10-24 years, and the fourth leading cause at ages 35-54. </p>
      <p>Over 50 percent of all people who die by suicide suffer from major depression. If one includes alcoholics who are depressed,<br> this figure rises to over 75 percent.</p>
      <p>It estimates that 4.4% of Kenya’s population – 1,952,981 people – suffered depression in 2015.Kenya does rank sixth in Africa<br> for the number of people with depression, but places eighth for the share of population suffering the disorder. The report doesn’t<br> give an estimate of suicides.</p>
      
      <h1>TYPES OF DEPRESSION</h1>
      <P>There are many types of depression. While they share some common symptoms, they also have some key differences.</P>
      
      <h2>Major depression</h2>
      <p>Major depression is also known as major depressive disorder, classic depression, or unipolar depression. It’s fairly common<br> in adults, about 16.2 million adults suffer from this.</p>
      <p>People with major depression experience symptoms most of the day, every day. Like many mental health conditions,<br> it has little to do with what’s happening around you. You can have a loving family, tons of friends, and a dream job.<br> You can have the kind of life that others envy and still have depression.</p>
