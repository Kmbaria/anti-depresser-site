      <h1>UNDERSTANDING DEPRESSION</h1>
      <img src="img/dp.jpeg" alt="dp" width="1000" height="400"><br><br>
      <p>Everyone goes through periods of deep sadness and grief. These feelings usually fade away within a few days or weeks, depending<br> on the circumstances. But profound sadness that lasts more than two weeks and affects your ability to function may be a sign of depression.</p>
      <p>Depression plays a role in more than one half of all suicide attempts in the world,<br> whereas the lifetime risk of suicide among patients with untreated depressive disorder is nearly 20%.<br> According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death in<br> Third World Countries, accounting for 36,909 deaths; it was the second leading cause of death in people 25-34 years of age,<br> the third leading cause in people aged 10-24 years, and the fourth leading cause at ages 35-54. </p>
      <p>Over 50 percent of all people who die by suicide suffer from major depression. If one includes alcoholics who are depressed,<br> this figure rises to over 75 percent.</p>
      <p>It estimates that 4.4% of Kenya’s population – 1,952,981 people – suffered depression in 2015.Kenya does rank sixth in Africa<br> for the number of people with depression, but places eighth for the share of population suffering the disorder. The report doesn’t<br> give an estimate of suicides.</p>
      
      <h1>TYPES OF DEPRESSION</h1>
      <P>There are many types of depression. While they share some common symptoms, they also have some key differences.</P>

      <p>People with major depression experience symptoms most of the day, every day. Like many mental health conditions,<br> it has little to do with what’s happening around you. You can have a loving family, tons of friends, and a dream job.<br> You can have the kind of life that others envy and still have depression.</p>
