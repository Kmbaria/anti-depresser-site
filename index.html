      <h1>UNDERSTANDING DEPRESSION</h1>
      <img src="img/dp.jpeg" alt="dp" width="1000" height="400"><br><br>
      <p>Everyone goes through periods of deep sadness and grief. These feelings usually fade away within a few days or weeks, depending<br> on the circumstances. But profound sadness that lasts more than two weeks and affects your ability to function may be a sign of depression.</p>
      <p>Depression plays a role in more than one half of all suicide attempts in the world,<br> whereas the lifetime risk of suicide among patients with untreated depressive disorder is nearly 20%.<br> According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death in<br> Third World Countries, accounting for 36,909 deaths; it was the second leading cause of death in people 25-34 years of age,<br> the third leading cause in people aged 10-24 years, and the fourth leading cause at ages 35-54. </p>
      <p>Over 50 percent of all people who die by suicide suffer from major depression. If one includes alcoholics who are depressed,<br> this figure rises to over 75 percent.</p>
      <p>It estimates that 4.4% of Kenya’s population – 1,952,981 people – suffered depression in 2015.Kenya does rank sixth in Africa<br> for the number of people with depression, but places eighth for the share of population suffering the disorder. The report doesn’t<br> give an estimate of suicides.</p>
      
      <h1>TYPES OF DEPRESSION</h1>
      <P>There are many types of depression. While they share some common symptoms, they also have some key differences.</P>
      
      <h2>Major depression</h2>
      <p>Major depression is also known as major depressive disorder, classic depression, or unipolar depression. It’s fairly common<br> in adults, about 16.2 million adults suffer from this.</p>
      <p>People with major depression experience symptoms most of the day, every day. Like many mental health conditions,<br> it has little to do with what’s happening around you. You can have a loving family, tons of friends, and a dream job.<br> You can have the kind of life that others envy and still have depression.</p>
      
      <h2>Persistent depression</h2>
      <p>Persistent depressive disorder is depression that lasts for two years or more. It’s also called dysthymia or chronic depression.<br> It might not feel as intense as major depression, but it can still strain relationships and make daily tasks difficult.</p>

      <h2>Manic depression or bipolar disorder</h2>
      <p>Manic depression consists of periods of mania or hypomania, where you feel very happy, alternating with episodes of depression.<br> Manic depression is an outdated name for bipolar disorder.</p>
      <p>In order to be diagnosed with bipolar I disorder, you have to experience an episode of mania that lasts for seven days,<br> or less if hospitalization is required. You may experience a depressive episode before or following the manic episode.</p>

      <h2>Depressive psychosis</h2>
      <p>Some people with major depression also go through periods of losing touch with reality. This is known as psychosis,<br> which can involve hallucinations and delusions. Experiencing both of these together is known clinically as major<br> depressive disorder with psychotic features. However, some providers still refer to this phenomenon as depressive<br> psychosis or psychotic depression.</p>
      
      <h2>Perinatal depression</h2>
      <p>Perinatal depression, which is clinically known as major depressive disorder with peripartum onset, occurs during pregnancy<br> or within four weeks of childbirth. It’s often called postpartum depression. But that term only applies to depression after giving<br> birth. Perinatal depression can occur while you’re pregnant.Hormonal changes that happen during pregnancy and childbirth<br> can trigger changes in the brain that lead to mood swings. </p>

      <h2>Seasonal depression</h2>
      <p>Seasonal depression, also called seasonal affective disorder and clinically known as major depressive disorder with seasonal<br> pattern, is depression that’s related to certain seasons. For most people, it tends to happen during the winter months.</p>

      <h2>Premenstrual dysphoric disorder</h2>
      <p>Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). While PMS symptoms<br> can be both physical and psychological, PMDD symptoms tend to be mostly psychological.These psychological<br> symptoms are more severe than those associated with PMS. For example, some women might feel more emotional in<br> the days leading up to their period. But someone with PMDD might experience a level of depression and sadness that<br> gets in the way of day-to-day functions.</p>

      <h2>Situational depression</h2>
      <p>Situational depression, clinically known as adjustment disorder with depressed mood, looks like major depression in many respects.<br> But it’s brought on by specific events or situations, such as: death of a loved one, severe illness, going through dirvoce or battling for child's<br> custody.</p>
